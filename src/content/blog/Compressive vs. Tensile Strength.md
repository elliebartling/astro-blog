# Compressive vs. Tensile Strength

Compressive strength is the strength of a material under compression. Concrete, for example, is very compressively strong because it resists compression (it can't be smooshed).

Tensile strength is the strength of a material to be stretched or pulled before breaking. Rebar, spider silk, and bamboo are tensile materials, because they can bend and not break.

### Examples

The human body needs bones to be strong in both ways: incompressible, to resist the pounding and pressure of movement, and tensile, to be able to resist the tension of tendons.
