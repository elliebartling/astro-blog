# Developing "X-Ray" vision as a Designer
In [[chess]], there is this concept of "x-ray attacking" — that is, a piece indirectly threatens another piece if it can "see through" a piece.

In design, we often talk about "looking around corners" but it's hard to visualize what that means, exactly. What corners? What's on the other side of them? Instead, one way to develop your thinking is to practice your "x-ray vision": what would the board look like if the features, assumptions, and resources that were in front of you moved? Would you have an opportunity? Or would you be faced with a threat? How might you mitigate that threat, or take advantage of that opportunity? Include those ideas in your design process as contingencies.
