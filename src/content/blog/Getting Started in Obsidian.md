# Getting started in [[Obsidian]] (or, how I take notes & actually use them)
A guide for how to think about note-taking, some ways note-taking can help you develop your thinking and growth, and how to write notes you can actually find again — with a tiiiiiny bit of tool walkthrough.

This guide assumes (and strongly recommends) that you are using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a note-taking app that's approved for internal use at Amazon. The advice here can to some extent be applied to other popular note-taking tools like Bear, Apple Notes, etc — but when you get to the linking section, you'll see why Obsidian is my tool of choice.

---
## First: Why are you taking notes?
Many of us feel like we should be taking notes because that's a thing people say we should do, or we see other people who seem Very Productive taking notes. But then, tell me if any of this sounds familiar: 

- You open a new note, and draw a blank on what to put in it
- You've created a bunch of notes and you've never once looked back at them
- You look for a note on something and can't understand what you meant by your own cryptic shorthand like: "important: add line!"
- You *know* you took a note about something, but can't figure out the right search terms to find it again 
- You took notes on a bunch of things, but when it comes time for Promo or Forte, you feel like there's no way to get a "summary" of your notes without looking back through all of them one by one, or you're left feeling like you have no idea what you did all year

Yeah, me too 😅 

[[Obsidian]] is an amazing tool, and is almost infinitely customizable. It can be as simple and easy as Apple Notes, or as complex as a fully-functioning DnD [Campaign Manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/v9uorp/obsidianmd_the_perfect_free_campaign_manager/) or a "[Second Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz99I7apNLI)." 

But what's more important than what *Obsidian* can do is: what do *you* want from your notes? 

No matter what tools you use or how you organize your thoughts, the foundation is the ==actual content of your notes==. Figuring out *why* you're writing notes will help with what to actually take notes about, how to write them, and how to write them consistently.

A few goals I have for my notes, which may also apply to you:

- Reflecting on goals, pain points, wins, and learnings over time
- Capturing decisions and feedback in one place, so I don't have to search 5 tools to find that one thing that so-and-so said two months ago
- Keeping ideas & important links I need to find again for a certain project all in one place (e.g., where was that one research report that Rachel sent me? where was that Figma link James sent?)
- Finding and thinking about connections between people, topics and projects; helping me "see the bigger picture" across topics
- Being reminded of ideas, questions, and updates I need to bring up with someone the next time I meet with them
- Keeping track of ideas & inspiration for writing, designs, or side-projects

That probably sounds like a lot, but these have developed over about 9 months. I started with just the first goal, and it completely changed how I approached note-taking. As an example, if I wanted to **reflect on my goals, pain points, wins, and learnings over time**, I knew I'd need to…

- actually *capture* those things in the moment, on a regular basis, because it's very easy to forget that kind of thing even a few days later. So I decided to take notes every day, for at least 2 minutes.
- actually be able to *find* those things & understand them later, like a list of wins for the year. So I decided to add **tags** that I could easily search for later, use complete sentences as often as I could, and frame things in the past tense ("I did XYZ" or "I learned XYZ" or "I struggled with XYZ") instead of a to-do list.

Which was *completely* different from how I'd been taking notes — sporadically, during important meetings, in different places, and mostly about things I needed to remember to do, not things I needed to remember *I did.*

To put it more concretely — my notes used to look like this:

- filter idea for noodle
- KXBR notes!!
- important: add line

*Yes, these are real example from my real notes. Hope that line wasn't too important, because I no longer have any idea what that was about.*

And using my goal as a framing, became more like:

- Met with Jenna, and we came up with a really cool idea for doing Big Little Updates more often.
- Idea: think about ways we can track the impact of Noodle over time.

That goal helped me decide how often to take notes (daily), what to take notes about (things I did or learned, or ideas I had, not things I need to do), how to structure those notes (like I might not remember everything perfectly later), and how I'd want to find them again (we'll get to that next).
### Examples
Some examples of goals you might have, and what kind of notes you'd need to take to achieve those goals:

| Goal                                                                                                                                                                                            | Type of notes                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I want to be able to find decisions and feedback in one place, so I don't have to search 5 tools to find that one thing that so-and-so said two months ago and/or which Slack has since deleted | Consistently logged meeting notes & feedback notes<br><br>Clearly tagging decisions, and writing them clearly enough that you'll remember what was decided |
| I want to track my wins, pain points, and learnings over time                                                                                                                                   | Consistently logging wins/pain points/learnings when they're fresh; tagging them consistently                                                              |
| Surfacing better connections between projects, topics & people                                                                                                                                  | Linking notes to people, projects, or topics                                                                                                               |


## Next: The Basics of "Linking Your Thinking" (or, how to find what you need later)
If any of your note taking goals involves "finding this later," you'll benefit from **linking.** In the context of note taking, linking means adding something to a note that connects it to another note. 

Why is linking useful? Because it's often convenient to take notes in one place, and then access them again in another place.

For example, with my goal of "reflecting on wins & pain points over time", it's much more convenient to jot down notes on a daily basis, in a new note each day. But later, what I really want is to see all my wins for the year, or all the ideas I had on a particular topic, or all the pain points I struggled with this month.

Scrolling through every single daily note is too cumbersome to be useful, and gets more difficult the more notes you take — the exact opposite of what you want your notes to be. Ideally, the usefulness of your notes *increases* as you take more notes.

And that's what linking is for: linking is how you can take notes in a place that's convenient, and then find them later where you need them.

There are three ways to link things in Obsidian:
1. **Folders:** Obsidian actually is just a nice way of looking at markdown files on your computer, so folders in Obsidian work *exactly* the same way as folders on your computer (you can even open a note in Finder, and see it in its Finder folder, too). Folders are mutually exclusive ways of grouping notes (a file can only live in one folder). I use folders sparingly, for broad categories of notes I want to use in the same way, or that all have a certain template (e.g., People, or Meetings).
2. **Tags**: this works very similarly to how tags work basically everywhere else — you type a # then the name of a tag, and presto! Stuff is tagged. I like using tags for things like "wins" and "hdt": concepts that might apply to notes across groups, or that I don't want to be mutually exclusive, and which are not themselves a concept that I'd make a note for.
3. **Wikilinks**: The most important type of linking in Obsidian is using actual (url) links. You can link a note to another note by typing `[[` anywhere in any note. Obsidian will bring up a menu that you can search to find any of your other notes. Select the note, and it'll get wrapped in two closing brackets `]]`. Your notes are now linked! You can click the link to go to the other note. If you're used to Notion, it's the equivalent of @-mentioning another page.

So — wiki links sound kinda boring at first, but they are actually incredible powerful. Unlike tags, folders, or links in web pages, links in Obsidian are **bi-directional**. That means that if you are taking notes in a meeting, and you link to a project that is mentioned during that meeting — your project note *knows that it's been linked to*. This is called a "backlink".

For example, let's say I have a note for a project ([[K20X]]) and also a bunch of meeting notes. Any time I mention K20X in any of my meeting notes, that note is now linked to my K20X note, and I can see all of those mentions in my K20X note. This means that I never have to figure out *where* I should put a note before I write it. I just write the note, and link to any concept that is relevant — and when I want to go back and see all the times I mentioned that project/person/idea, it's all compiled into the note for me.

← show side by side of note mentioning topic and topic →

But what should you link, and what does that look like? It's up to you and what you want to be able to find again later. I like to create notes for people, projects, concepts, and meetings — but there are lots of different "systems" and it just depends on what makes the most sense to you. A few of the popular ones are:

- PARA: Projects (efforts with start and end dates), Areas (related content or activities), Resources, Archive
- [[Zettelkasten]]: a notetaking methodology for research, it includes: literature notes (highlights of things other people have written), fleeting notes (drafts or quick capture ideas), permanent notes (final, thoughtful explorations of ideas)
- Johnny Decimal: 

If you're just starting out, I'd stay away from adopting a particular system too early. Think about your goals, and what you'll want to find again later. Make notes for those things, and link to them along the way. Adopt systems and structure ==when it helps you do something more efficiently or easily that you're already doing==. Don't adopt systems or process "prospectively" — that's a good way to create a lot of unnecessary complexity.

To demonstrate, here's how my notes changed:

Original notes: cryptic, more of a to-do list than a record of what I've done, doesn't help with my goals:
- send noodle email
- KXBR notes!!
- important: add line

Becomes: understandable, focused on information I'll actually use later.
- Met with Jenna and discussed a cool idea for big little updates 
- Decided that we would not do filter-persistence as a P0

Becomes: cross-linked to notes and tags
- Met with [[Jenna Abts|Jenna]] and discussed a cool idea for [[Big Little Updates|Big Little Updates]]
- #Decision that we would not do [[filter-persistence]] as a P0 for [[02 Maps/Areas/Search|Search]]

What does that do besides add some colors to our notes? Well, now that our notes are linked, we can start to see connections where they're actually useful.

Let's say a few months go by, and there's a new ask for search. A question comes up about a certain feature — and, well, it's been a few months, so I need to refresh my memory on what we decided to do, and when. Instead of crawling back through all my notes, I can go to the Search page and see all the mentions of it across my notes. 

![[CleanShot 2024-06-14 at 15.10.22.mp4]]

Everyone has their own favorite way to use tags vs. links, but here's how I like to use them:
- **Tags** are for ephemeral things like "wins" or "hotly debated topics" or "bias for action". They cross over projects, people, and meetings. They don't necessarily have their own information that needs to get captured. 
- **Links** (or pages) are for anything that might need its own page — a person, a project ([[K20X]]), a meeting, or a concept ([[Filters]]). Pages are a more powerful way of linking, and can have their own data (like date created), so if I expect I might want to find [my-possible-new-tag-or-link] in a list of similar items by date etc, I'll usually choose to make it a Link.

Ultimately it's up to you, and its incredibly flexible. If you decide a tag should actually be a page, it's easy to change that later.


> [!NOTE] Nested Tags
> Obsidian supports nested tags, but I personally find them annoying to use & manage. Pages have an "alias" property, so if you want to refer to your Projects/K20X note as just K20X, you can do that. (And you can't with tags.)
> 
> But if you do go the nested tags route, definitely check out the Fuzzy Tag Search plugin, which will allow you to type the part of the tag that's relevant to you.

## Just take the notes
After that — just take notes :)

One of the easiest ways to get started is to take Daily Notes. Turn on the "Daily Notes" plugin, or browse community plugins for "[Periodic Notes](obsidian://show-plugin?id=periodic-notes)" (this plugin supports Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly & Yearly notes, too, if you'd benefit from that).

![[CleanShot 2024-06-14 at 15.26.43@2x.png]]

Start jotting down what you did today — what meetings you had, what thoughts you had, what you might want to think about later. Link things you might want to find again later.


> [!NOTE] Tips
> - Bullet lists are easy to query later, if that's something you think you might do. Lists of any kind are also **individually** queryable — so a list item tagged \#win can show up on its own, as well as the page it's in. I put almost everything in a list.
> - Obsidian supports "page properties" which is similar to Notion's properties, if you miss having categorization at the top of your pages.


## Templates: Make computers do the boring, repetitive stuff
Lastly — once you've gotten into a little bit of an habit, invest a little time into note templates. You can make these as simple or as complicated as you want, but it often helps to have a little bit of structure to your notes, which stays relatively consistent over time.

For example, my project note template looks like this:

← show project note →

Simple, but by reminding me to add myself and my partners to the project, I will automatically have a list of all the projects someone is working on.

A great daily note might look like:

← daily simple example →

And a more complex one might look like:

← daily medium →

And a random idea note might look like this:

← idea note →

Templates help ensure that you can focus on *writing notes* instead of *managing and remembering metadata* about your notes.
## Step 5: Add-ons I use, and how I use them

### Themes
Obsidian lets you customize how it looks via the Appearance section in settings. I use the Minimal Theme — it's super stable, beautiful, and, with the Minimal Theme Settings plugin, comes with lots of color options (I like Rosé Pine) & other customizations (square tasks).

### Plugins + Features
#### Daily note-taking
[Periodic Notes:](obsidian://show-plugin?id=periodic-notes)
This is an extension of the "Daily Notes" feature that Obsidian comes with standard. It allows you to additionally create Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly & Yearly notes. I use Weekly notes to set my intentions for the week (1 - 3 things I absolutely need to do), and then summarize/reflect at the end of the week (1 - 3 things that went well, went badly, wins I had or that others had).

I haven't done Monthly, Quarterly or Yearly notes, but now that I've got quite a few notes, I plan to use these to focus in on longer-term goals and reflections, such as Forte.

[Calendar](obsidian://show-plugin?id=calendar)
A really simple widget that gives you a visual calendar that allows you to jump to different daily or weekly notes. Pairs really well with either Daily Notes or Periodic Notes.


#### Visual nice-to-haves
[Contextual Typography](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-contextual-typography)
Super simple spacing fix for headings that are next to each other.
![[CleanShot 2024-06-14 at 18.23.17@2x.png|200]]

[Iconize](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-icon-folder)
Add icons to your files and folders, because icons are nice.

List Callouts 
List Callouts lets you add visual flourish to list items that begin with a certain word or phrase. So for example:
![[CleanShot 2024-06-14 at 18.38.43.gif]]
I like to pair this with Dataview (see below), using [Inline Fields](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/#inline-fields). This way, in a particular note, I can quickly scan for any decisions, wins, ideas, or tips, and then using Dataview, I can see those inline fields in a table. But even if you don't use Dataview, it can be super nice to just quickly visually see the most important lines in a file.


#### Finding connections
The most important part of Obsidian, for me, is finding connections to other notes. To do that most easily & naturally, I have a few settings turned on & plugins that I use.

[Backlinks + Show backlinks in a note](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks#Show+backlinks+in+a+note)
This is an Obsidian "Core" plugin, which means you don't have to download anything extra, you just have to turn it on. Backlinks show you all the notes *that link to the note you're currently viewing.* So instead of just being able to see what you've linked to from your note, you can now see any notes that mention your note. By turning on the "Show backlinks in a note" setting, you can see all those mentions on a page.

![[CleanShot 2024-06-14 at 18.45.43@2x 1.png]]
*Example: on this note that I have about Obsidian, you can see all the places I've mentioned the word "Obsidian" anywhere in my vault.*

It's a super powerful setting, and lets you easily see where there are connections between your current note and another note. For me, this means its way easier to take notes where I currently am: if I have my Daily Note open, and I want to save an idea for later related to a specific project, I just mention the project in a line with my idea, and it'll show up automatically in that project note.

Obsidian also brilliantly shows you *unlinked mentions* — so if you didn't know something would be important but later realized you should have been linking to it all along, Obsidian's got you. You can still see all the mentions that you didn't link.

Dataview [For Power Users]
This one might be a little intimidating, so proceed with caution. You absolutely **do not** need Dataview to get great things out of Obsidian — but if you want more of what Backlinks does, and in more custom ways, Dataview can do it.

There are about a million things you can do with Dataview, but the way I use it most often is to create "roll up" views of files with additional metadata. For example, meetings I had in a week, with a column for decisions made; notes related to a project, with a column for follow-ups or ideas, etc.

![[CleanShot 2024-06-14 at 19.19.06@2x.png]]
*An example Dataview I add to my weekly note to recap the meetings I had that week, who I met with, what projects we covered, any links they shared, and any callouts/questions and decisions.* 

Most of this information is automatically generated by the Amazon Meetings & PhoneTool plugins — I just add notes that look like this:
![[CleanShot 2024-06-14 at 19.24.28@2x.png]]
And it magically gets rolled up. No annoying data entry. Just focus on your notes, link things when you can.


Templates
Not really a connection finding plugin, but a way to automatically structure your notes to make it easy to find things again. You can either use Obsidian's out of the box "templates" core plugin (which is excellent), or if you need something more complex & dynamic, you can install Templater (which is like Templates Pro Edition).

I use templates for my daily notes, my weekly note, my meeting notes, and my project notes. 

#### Utilities
[FuzzyTag](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-fuzzytag)
Lets you search for tags using "fuzzy" search — basically, it makes tag search the way it should be out of the box, but isn't, for some reason.

Copy as HTML 
This is useful if you want to copy a note into a Slack message. Slack weirdly uses a different kind of markdown which messes up all your bolding & lists, but interprets HTML just fine. 🤷‍♀️

Various Complements 
This is a complex plugin but it's also really useful: basically, it indexes your vault and gives you suggestions as you type, including links and aliases. I use it constantly to quickly link to a file that's somewhere in my vault, but don't want to remember the exact name or type out the full alias.


#### Amazon-Built Plugins
Amazonians have built a few really helpful plugins, too, and I use these constantly.

[Phonetool](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Obsidian.md/#HPhoneTool)
Lets you search for & create pages for anyone who works at Amazon, including all the info you might want from PhoneTool.

[Amazon Meetings](https://code.amazon.com/packages/Obsidian-amazon-meetings-plugin/trees/mainline)
Grabs your meetings straight from the Amazon Meetings website. Lets you quickly create a note for a given meeting, including the people who attended, the description, the date/time, etc.

[Quip](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Obsidian.md/#HQuip)
Lets you bring a Quip file into Obsidian, and/or publish a new Quip file from Obsidian. I use this to draft documents in Obsidian, and then post them to Quip so others can view them (but I can still find them with the rest of my stuff).

## How do you balance taking notes and paying attention during meetings?
- take short cryptic notes first, then spend 5 minutes at the end of the meeting to clean up the important things 
- Incorporate others notes 
- Write down what someone is saying 
- Write down what you want to say before you say it

## Wait but what about Asana?
I absolutely still use Asana! But they are good at different things, so I use them in different ways.

- Asana is amazing for tracking deliverables, tasks, and sprint/roadmap planning. Asana has great UX for dates, bandwidth tracking, Kanban, statuses, points and goals. It has notes/project briefs, but they sort of suck.
- Obsidian is GREAT at notes and knowledge management. It excels at linking and keeping track of ideas, feedback and notes. It has tasks, and they can be good for certain things (like taking action items in a meeting instead of having to go to asana to log them), but in my experience, it takes a bit of tinkering to get it into a reliable task management system. 

That said — people definitely do it, and there are hundreds of tutorials online for how to set it up if you'd like to try. And if you're into the bullet journal style of task management, you might feel really at home in Obsidian. But if you're just getting started and you already have a task management workflow you like and trust, there's no need to reinvent the wheel.

For an overview of how I bring Asana tasks into my [[Obsidian]] workflow, check out [[Asana + Obsidian]]
