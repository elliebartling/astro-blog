# Learning with the garage door up
The practice of learning in public, sharing as you go, not waiting for something to be perfect or exactly right or finished before letting others see it.

[[Notes/202406301520 Learning with the garage door up|Learning with the garage door up]] is messy and vulnerable and [[authenticity|authentic]]. It's a journey into the unknown, while asking others to come with you — it is strictly *not* offering to guide, to direct, to know where this journey is going to lead. It's just asking, "would you like to come with?"

It's also, in a way, a little bit [[Playfulness|playful]], isn't it? Because, after all, how seriously can you really take yourself when you don't know what you're doing yet? Being playful demands a "letting go" of constraints, pressing pause on your nagging, continuous fear of messing up. And so, too, does "learning with the garage door up" — it's a way of acknowledging that you will mess up, it will be public, and actually, isn't that kind of delightful in its own way? Letting others see your own humanity, your own fallibility and authenticity and resilience, is a way of inviting them to know you, to understand you, to play with you, too.
