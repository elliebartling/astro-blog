# Motte & Bailey Fallacy
The "Motte & Bailey" fallacy is a common logical fallacy that implies that if an obvious, modest statement is true, a related but less defensible statement is also true.

E.g., Motte: "Statistically speaking, if the universe is infinite, there has to be intelligent life out there somewhere." and Bailey: "That weird light in the sky is an alien spacecraft."

## History
The fallacy is named after a castle structure, where there was a more defensible location in the castle (the "motte"), and a less defensible location (the "bailey"). In war time defensive strategy, the defenders would begin in the bailey, where they could have the most advantage from an offensive position, and retreat to the motte when they were unable to defend the bailey. 

In logical arguments, people often structure the fallacy in the same way: they begin with an outrageous, indefensible statement, and then retreat to a rock-solid statement when someone questions their original claim. By defending the more defensible claim, it appears that the original claim is equally defensible, but it is not.
