# On being right a lot, by being wrong a lot first

- You can’t get to “are right a lot” without being willing to be wrong a lot
- We are often asked to “trust our instincts and expertise” — but often the best way to be right is to *intentionally distrust* your instincts.
- Ask: what would it look like if I was wrong?
- Make it a game: if I wanted to do this as badly as possible, how would I go about it?
