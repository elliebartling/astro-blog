# Opportunity Cost
When you make a choice to do something, you are equally choosing not to do something else. Opportunity cost is the value of the "something else" that you could have had, if you'd made a different decision.

Resources are finite: money, time, etc. So choosing to use them in one way means they're unavailable for other things.

> In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the best alternative forgone where, given limited resources, a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives. Assuming the best choice is made, it is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice.
