# Playing chess with/against yourself

I take a lot of lessons from chess into my life. That sounds a little odd to say — it's the kind of thing you might hear from a character in a movie, quoting [[The Art of War]] or using a tired chess metaphor to explain the conflict of the plot.

But the thing that's interesting about chess is that you can play against yourself. And one of the things I've found interesting is thinking about how I'd apply a certain chess principle to my life, as if I were playing both sides of the board.

Because, actually, that's how I often feel in relationship with my own mind.

For example: a classic tactic in chess called "attraction" is to sacrifice a piece as a "decoy" to lure a more valuable opposing piece into a position where it's under attack.

[Look for ways to attract pieces into a knight fork](Look%20for%20ways%20to%20attract%20pieces%20into%20a%20knight%20fork.md)

This sounds very adversarial when applied to life — but what if you're playing chess against yourself?

I use this tactic all the time to "attract" myself into doing tasks, habits, and workflows I would never otherwise be motivated to do, except that now that I'm here I kind of have to. Using more alluring set ups — like going for an ice cream, or playing a game somewhere, or tinkering with a hobby — I can put myself in a position where doing another thing — gong to the gym, doing a few tasks on my list — is much easier and less annoying to do.
