# The Lucas Critique

The Lucas Critique asserts that historical relationships between variables become irrelevant once economic policies change, suggests policy-makers need to incorporate changing human expectations when predicting policy impact, and led to a major shift in economic model design, i.e., the development of "New Classical Macroeconomics".

In other words, once you begin to measure and incentivize something, you change the way people behave, and your metric may not be a true measurement anymore.

E.g., measuring productivity by number of projects delivered incentivizes project delivery and not necessarily productivity. Teams might break up larger projects into smaller ones inefficiently to score higher on the incentivized metric.
