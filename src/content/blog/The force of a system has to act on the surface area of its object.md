# The force of a system has to act on the surface area of its object
The force of an input relies on the traction it has with what it is trying to effect. The power of an engine means nothing if the tires of the a car are stripped bald. The strength of the human leg means nothing if the feet are injured. The force of a system acts on the surface area of what it impacts, and if that surface area is smooth or broken, the system won't work.
