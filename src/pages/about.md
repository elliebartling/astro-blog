# About

I'm Ellie. Currently a **designer at Kindle**, working on the future of search, defining an information architecture to support a [XX] million dollar business, and creating systems at work that spark innovation, creativity, and joy.

This site is a place for me to share thoughts on things I'm reading, discovering, and thinking about. It is part of my current [[side-quest]] to [[learn with the garage door open]]. Everything here is a work in progress.
